# Online Learning Dropout Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a student is likely to drop out of an online course based on academic and demographic features.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
To identify students at risk of dropping out early, so that institutions can take preventive actions such as academic support or mentoring.
