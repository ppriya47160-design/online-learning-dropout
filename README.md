#  Online Learning Dropout Prediction using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning–based project that predicts whether a student is likely to drop out of an online course using academic and demographic data.  
This project helps educational institutions identify at-risk students early and take preventive actions.

---

##  Problem Statement

Online learning platforms face high dropout rates due to lack of engagement, academic difficulty, and personal factors.  
Early identification of students at risk of dropping out can help institutions provide timely support and improve course completion rates.
